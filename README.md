# CARC-R-
Repo for jus tthe R code that went into the 2025 GPHY484R CARC project.

This repo contains several scripts that filter a planet sataset to the boundaries of CARC farm and creates a series of NDVI images, creates a GIF of said images, creates a shiny R app that allows you to click through these images at whatever dates you want, and finally sets up the tiffs in a way where they can be worked within Arc pro to make a time-aware mosaic.
 
Unfortunately, the "full_set" RDS is bigger than is natively supported by github and as such cant be stored here.
To get around this, you can generate the full_set RDS locally, either on your device or in tempest, save it as an RDS, and work form there.
